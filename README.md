Work in progress.

Demo from an earlier version:

Right now you can test player and block detection.  
Make sure you're not wearing any hats/hair/masks, enter a world filled with Wooden Platforms (one row is enough, as long as it fills the screen), set your skin color in Main/Settings.cs and run the project. A debug form will appear with information on where you are and, if there are Laser Grids in front of you, distance to the nearest block.
