Memory-based farming bot for Growtopia.

For more info & development notes, check out [**this server**](https://discord.gg/4VJHFy6pRn).

## Overview
What this tool CAN do:
 - Simulate human-like keyboard input to move forward and punch, breaking lines of blocks.
 - Advance to the next row (once the feature has been properly configured).
 - Overall, help in a normal farming routine by automating the breaking process.

What this tool CANNOT do:
 - Place any blocks.
 - Break blocks that aren't placed in a straight line.
 - Hack the game, steal accounts, etc.  
(I've had issues from children trying to do that, so I have to mention it)

## How this works
I'm currently overhauling the UI so it's hard to say. Check back later, or check the server mentioned above.

## Notes
This project used to rely on graphical detection. For those versions, check `graphics-based` branch.
