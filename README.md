Farming bot for Growtopia.  
I'm no longer maintaining the Releases tab, so please clone and build the latest version yourself. Latest version of .NET Framework is required.  
For any questions contact me at TheLeftExit@4325 on Discord.

Recent version's interface:

## How this works
 - Stand in front of a row of blocks.
 - Configure the settings (your block ID and so on).
 - Press Start (or Alt+S) to start breaking.
 - The tool will keep breaking until there are no more blocks or you manually cancel it.
 - You can configure an end-of-row script to break multiple rows automatically.

## Notes
This project has recently been updated from graphical detection to directly working with the game's memory. For previous versions, check `graphics-based` branch.
